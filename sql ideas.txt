is this only for one fridge? or multiple fridges? How many backends do we have?
Likely one total backend, so now we need total fridges
Assuming a shelf that is removed has no items on it
If a shelf is removed from a fridge that has items on it, those items are all lost!
Does the app know which fridge it is? and how many shelves it has? and which shelf is which?

Fridge table likely not necessary
//Fridge?: ID, Owner

Fridge-Shelf: Fid, Sid

shelf individual table likely not necessary
//Shelf?:

Shelf-Item: Sid, ItemID

Item: ID, weight, name, quantity (how do I connect quantity and weight?), DOE, BBD
